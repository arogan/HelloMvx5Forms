# HelloMvx5Forms
test navigation in new mvvmcross 5 forms

issue:
For some reason 2 instances of the DetailViewModel is getting created.  The first one initialize is called and the parameter is passed from master correctly but it is the SECOND instance that is getting used with my DetailPage view.  Why are 2 instances of the DetailViewModel being created?
