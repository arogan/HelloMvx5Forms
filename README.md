# HelloMvx5Forms
test navigation in new mvvmcross 5 forms
Built using latest Visual Studio for Mac.  Using latest MVVMCross 5.0.1 for all nuget libraries.

issue:
For some reason 2 instances of the DetailViewModel is getting created.  The first one initialize is called and the parameter is passed from master correctly but it is the SECOND instance that is getting used with my DetailPage view.  Why are 2 instances of the DetailViewModel being created?
